# Cross-Compiling for Raspberry Pi

This repository provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up and perform cross-compilation from a host machine (e.g., Linux/MacOS) to a Raspberry Pi. Cross-compiling allows you to build applications on your powerful host machine and deploy them to the Raspberry Pi, saving time and resources.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure the following:

1. **Host Machine**:
   - A Linux or macOS system with necessary tools installed (`gcc`, `g++`, `cmake`, etc.).
   - `rsync` for synchronizing files.
   - A cross-compiler toolchain for the Raspberry Pi (e.g., `arm-linux-gnueabihf`).

2. **Target (Raspberry Pi)**:
   - A Raspberry Pi running a Linux distribution (e.g., Raspbian, Raspberry Pi OS).
   - SSH access to the Raspberry Pi.
   - Sufficient space for libraries and files.

3. **Network Connection**:
   - Both the host and the Raspberry Pi should be on the same network, and SSH should be enabled on the Raspberry Pi.
